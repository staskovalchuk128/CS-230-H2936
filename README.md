<b>Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?</b>

The Gaming Room, having achieved success as a mobile app game creator, launched a puzzle competition game on the Android platform. Subsequently, the client expressed the desire to extend the game's accessibility to a broader audience by developing a web-based version, ensuring compatibility across various platforms and devices.

<b>What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?</b>

I crafted a thorough recommendation section that highlighted crucial considerations for the client. This encompassed aspects such as the host operating system (OS), memory and storage management solutions on host servers, the API framework, security measures, and the advantages of adopting serverless architecture for product launch. I presented a compelling argument explaining why a cloud platform stood out as the optimal choice aligned with the client's objectives.

<b>What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?</b>

Examining the domain model, illustrated as a UML class diagram, proved advantageous for grasping the composition and connections among entities representing various app components. This facilitated the creation of succinct classes with clear methods, utilizing other entities in a direct manner to construct a streamlined prototype.

<b>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</b>

Enhancing the evaluation section that compares and contrasts popular operating systems (e.g., Mac, Windows, Linux) and mobile platforms would benefit from a more thorough exploration of the nuances specific to the client side. The primary focus lies on the web browser, serving as the key engine for running the client's application. Research into the intricacies of operating systems for web-based solutions yielded limited insights. A more in-depth analysis of OS preferences for specific browsers (e.g., Windows with Edge, Mac with Safari) could be conducted to determine whether non-preferred browsers introduce technical or performance constraints.

<b>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</b>

Critical considerations for users in the development of web-based apps include speed and intuitiveness, commonly referred to as usability. While quality characteristics such as the look and feel of the app are important, they hold a lesser weight in comparison to speed and usability. Users might persist with an app despite aesthetic preferences, but they are likely to abandon it if functionality is unclear or if the app operates slowly. Prioritizing user needs is paramount, given that users, as consumers of the product, represent the primary source of revenue for the client.

<b>How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?</b>

When designing software, commence with a broad perspective and gradually refine it with precision. Begin with high-level objectives and iterate through various stages to evolve them into the ultimate solution. For instance, a client's business goals can be deconstructed into functional requirements, delineating the essential functionalities necessary to achieve those objectives. These functional requirements can be further dissected into technical requirements, outlining the technical strategy for fulfilling those functions. Subsequently, these technical requirements can be transformed into design documents, architectural plans, and actual code, thus fulfilling the requirements and culminating in the final solution.
